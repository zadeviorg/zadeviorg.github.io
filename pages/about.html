<h2>BACKGROUND TO THE ORGANISATION</h2>
<p>The Zambia Association For the Development of the Visually impaired was Founded by 
Mr Mwila Elias who is a Primary school teacher by profession and has been visually 
impaired since the age of 4. After realising that most of his counterparts ( the Visually 
impaired) often have to resort to street begging as a means for survival, he wanted to find 
ways of ensuring that they were empowered with skills that would enable them become self sufficient</p>
